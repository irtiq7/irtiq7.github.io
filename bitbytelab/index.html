					Hello and welcome to Bytebytelab, an place where I can share my research in audio processing and robotics.
					<br>
					<br>
					I have Ph.D. degree in audio processing in robotics from <a href="https://www.aau.dk" id="aalborgUni">Aalborg University</a>, Denmark. As part of my research, I am interested in exploring and investigating robot perception. More specifically, I am interested in exploring sound-based techniques to construct spatial map of an environment. One way to achieve this is to get inspiration from animals such as bats, dolphins and rats. In darkness, these animals probes the envionment with a known sound which gets reflected by a surface. The knowledge of these acoustic echoes aids the animal to perceive their environments which helps them in navigation, and hunting.
					<br>
					<br>
					Therefore, the aim of my research is to design a sound processing techniques that could enable robotic platforms to probe the environment and use the acoustic echoes to construct a spatial map of an environment. The novalty of this research is that we propose a generalized algorithm that takes ego-noise, background noise, and interfering sources into account. The proposed algorithm can detect can estimate the time of arrival (TOA) as well as the direction of arrival (DOA) of the acoustic echoes which is essential for map generation.
