        <p>Hi there!<br>I made a new open-source project called LOOC Mapper. I made this software sometimes ago to help me with my codebase work especially when I am task in designing and rewriting new codes. This software help me understand the structure of my codebase and decice how many lines of code do I need to work on.</p>

        <p>Hi there!<br>Welcome to bitbytelab. My name is Usama Saqib. I received my Ph.D. in signal processing in robotics from Aalborg University, Denmark (2021), M.Sc in Embedded Systems Engineering (2015) and a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering (2011). I have a passion for cutting-edge technologies, especially, robotics and signal processing. During my Ph.D., I have authored several research papers and published my findings in several reputed conferences. My thesis is titled <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/528831183/PHD_US.pdf">"Acoustic Echo Estimation using the model-based approach with Application to Spatial Map Construction in Robotics."</a> In this blog, I share my passion for robotics and signal processing.</p>
        <p class="postdata">Posted on 19.OCT.23 by <a href="#">Usama Saqib</a></p>
        <p>Working on a pitch estimator using WebAPI. This was my first attempt to learn and use webAPI to estimate pitch of an audio source. The application access a user's microphone and estimate the fundamental frequency of the sound recorded by the microphone. The corresponding estimate is displayed on the webpage.</p>
        <p class="postdata">Posted on 14.SEPT.22 by <a href="#">Usama Saqib</a></p>
        <p>Repository for my IROS 2020 paper is available! <a href="https://github.com/irtiq7/iROS2020">[LINK]</a><br>In this work, we proposed an audio processing algorithm that was tested on a proof of concept robotic platform to construct spatial map of an environment using echolocation.</p>
