					Hi there!
					<br>
					I made a new open-source project called LOOC Mapper. I made this software sometimes ago to help me with my codebase work
					especially when I am task in designing and rewriting new codes. This software help me understand the structure of my codebase
					and decice how many lines of code do I need to work on.

					Hi there!
					<br>
					Welcome to bitbytelab. My name is Usama Saqib. I received my Ph.D. in signal processing in robotics from Aalborg University, Denmark (2021), M.Sc in Embedded Systems Engineering (2015) and a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering (2011). I have a passion for cutting-edge technologies, especially, robotics and signal processing. During my Ph.D., I have authored several research papers and published my findings in several reputed conferences. My thesis is titled <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/528831183/PHD_US.pdf">"Acoustic Echo Estimation using the model-based approach with Application to Spatial Map Construction in Robotics."</a> In this blog, I share my passion for robotics and signal processing.

					Working on a pitch estimator using 
WebAPI. This was my first attempt to learn and use webAPI to estimate pitch 
of an audio source. The application access a user's microphone and estimate the fundamental frequency of the sound recorded by the microphone. The corresponding estimate is displayed on the webpage.
