					Hi there!
					<br>
					I made a new open-source project called LOOC Mapper. I made this software sometimes ago to help me with my codebase work
					especially when I am task in designing and rewriting new codes. This software help me understand the structure of my codebase
					and decice how many lines of code do I need to work on.

						<a href="https://github.com/irtiq7/LOCC_Mapper">[LOCC Mapper]</a>: Line of Code and Connectivity (LOCC) Mapper
						Visualize, Analyze, and Map File Relationships in Your Codebase
						
						Introducing LOCC Mapper
						The ultimate tool for developers and teams to gain deep insights into their codebases. Whether youâ€™re working on a small project or managing a large-scale application, LOCC Mapper is designed to help you understand and optimize your code structure effortlessly.

					Hi there!
					<br>
					Welcome to bitbytelab. My name is Usama Saqib. I received my Ph.D. in signal processing in robotics from Aalborg University, Denmark (2021), M.Sc in Embedded Systems Engineering (2015) and a B.Sc in Electrical Engineering (2011). I have a passion for cutting-edge technologies, especially, robotics and signal processing. During my Ph.D., I have authored several research papers and published my findings in several reputed conferences. My thesis is titled <a href="https://vbn.aau.dk/ws/files/528831183/PHD_US.pdf">"Acoustic Echo Estimation using the model-based approach with Application to Spatial Map Construction in Robotics."</a> In this blog, I share my passion for robotics and signal processing.

					Working on a pitch estimator using 
WebAPI. This was my first attempt to learn and use webAPI to estimate pitch 
of an audio source. The application access a user's microphone and estimate the fundamental frequency of the sound recorded by the microphone. The corresponding estimate is displayed on the webpage.

					Repository for my IROS 2020 paper is available! <a href="https://github.com/irtiq7/iROS2020">[LINK]</a>
					<br>
					In this work, we proposed an audio processing algorithm that was tested on a proof of concept robotic platform to construct spatial map of an environment using echolocation.
